                "description": "The Roadhouse is a roots program emphasizing the blues and other traditional styles of American music. The show presents the wide and wonderful spectrum of our musical legacy - the roots of todays popular music and culture. The show explores regional differences in American recordings with a decidely Southern bent. \\n\\nAs a programmer/producer, my goal is to create a mix of American music that transcends simple definitions and catergories of style. I play blues, but also country blues, piano blues, folk blues, zydeco, punk blues and whatever new interpretations come along. I play country and folk, but also old-time mountain music, bluegrass, singer/songwriters, cajun, folk/country rock, and any revival that comes next. In addition, the show recogonizes the importance of the church in the developement of popular American music - gospel spirituals laid a foundation for bluegrass, rhythm and blues and soul music. I try to play the new with the old, and the known next to the unknown. \\n\\nUltimately, I hope the show is an alternative to what's known as \"American roots\" or any \"boomer\" definition of roots-rock turns classic-rock. I play a mix which hopefully turns the familiar fresh and demostrates that we always return to the source - it's just one music eventually. \\n\\n-Greg Vandy "

Now! \\n\\nIn recent years, jazz has been cast in an unfortunate historical context -- as something that already happened, and is now over. Or, individual \"experts\" are too willing to narrowly define jazz - like; it sounds like this, and like that, and like this -- and if it doesn't, it isn't jazz. \\n\\nI think instead, that jazz, like any vibrant art form, has a mandate to expand and recreate itself -- to try new things, to get better, or at least to be different today than it was yesterday. Certainly jazz has a rich history. But part of that history is expansion and progression. Jazz never has stood still for long, there's no reason to think is should now. \\n\\nIn programming Jazz Theater I look for compelling work by artists who have been willing to blaze new trails. Clearly they have all studied the history of jazz, and thankfully they are not willing to be confined by it. Some of Jazz Theater will be familiar and, hopefully, some of it will be like nothing you've ever heard before. \\n\\n-John Gilbreath"
